## Download high-coverage VCF files

From 1000 Genome Project, we download high-coverage (30X) VCF files containing 3202 samples ([folder link][2]).

!!! warning
    Be sure to {==verify the MD5 checksums of the VCF files==}. Due to their large size, file transfers may be prone to interruption or corruption during transmission.

??? code
    Code was used to download VCF files containing 3202 samples.
    ```bash linenums="1"
    --8<-- "processing_data/download_total_vcf.sh"
    ```
    [md5sum_meta][3] contains information to verified md5sum of downloaded VCF files ([source][4])


## Filtering variants

VCF files were filtered to retain only bi-allelic SNPs with an allele count â‰¥ 2 to reduce noise in imputation and evaluation.

??? code
    ```bash linenums="1"
    --8<-- "processing_data/filter_variants.sh"
    ```

    [Sample list][5] of 2504 selected samples.


!!! output
    - Raw imputation panel
