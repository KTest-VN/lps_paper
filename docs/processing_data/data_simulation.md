- Low-pass sequencing (LPS): Simulated at six coverage levels (0.5xâ€“2.0x) from mapped CRAM files, adjusting for a 9% duplication rate and incorporating realistic coverage variability.

- SNP Arrays: Eight genotyping arrays are simulated using known marker sets and harmonized to hg38. Pseudo-array data is generated by removing phasing information.
